//! The ONE definition of the generated-term fixture the traversal tests of a dozen
//! crates draw from.
//!
//! A `tests/` target and a `src/` unit test of another crate are separate compilation
//! units that can only share code through a library, and a source file included by
//! path from another package is outside that package's published tarball, so the
//! fixture lives here, shipped `#[doc(hidden)]` at the crate root exactly as
//! `purrdf_rdf::gts_fixtures` is: built from the same crate, not public API, called by
//! no shipping code path. It draws from `purrdf_hash::mix`, the workspace's one
//! SplitMix64, so every crate's tests see the same stream for the same seed.
