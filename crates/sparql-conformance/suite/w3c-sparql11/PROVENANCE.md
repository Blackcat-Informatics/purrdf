# Vendored W3C SPARQL 1.1 conformance fixtures

This tree vendors a **curated subset** of the official W3C SPARQL 1.1 test suite,
exercising the exotic-aggregation, deep-subquery, and federated-`SERVICE` surface.
It is consumed by the native conformance harness (`crates/sparql-conformance`).

## Source

- Upstream: **W3C `rdf-tests`** — <https://github.com/w3c/rdf-tests>,
  path `sparql/sparql11/`.
- Mirror of the W3C DAWG/SPARQL-WG test suite at
  <https://www.w3.org/2009/sparql/docs/tests/>.
- The curated `aggregates`/`subquery`/`service` subset was fetched from the
  `main` branch on **2026-06-26**.
- The full query-eval groups (see below) are vendored **verbatim** at the pinned
  commit **`426c7df4b5d5d292e3ba09dc22e622ea301f230a`** — every file, `manifest.ttl`
  included, carries its own `LicenseRef-W3C-Test-Suite` `.license` sidecar.

## Full W3C query-eval groups (commit `426c7df`)

Ten groups are vendored verbatim and discovered automatically by the harness
(one nextest case per `manifest.ttl`). Unlike the curated subset, these ship the
**upstream** `manifest.ttl` verbatim (sidecar'd), so the whole group runs. Every
non-passing case is recorded in `crates/sparql-conformance/src/xfail.rs` with a
typed reason — nothing is silently skipped.

| Group | Cases | Green | Ledgered (reason) |
|-------|------:|------:|-------------------|
| bind | 10 | 10 | — |
| bindings | 11 | 1 | 9 parse-unsupported (VALUES), 1 result-format |
| cast | 6 | 0 | 6 value-mismatch (XSD cast lexical/datatype) |
| construct | 7 | 2 | 1 parse-unsupported, 4 unsupported-construct (CONSTRUCT WHERE) |
| exists | 6 | 5 | 1 unsupported-construct (EXISTS over GRAPH var) |
| functions | 75 | 59 | 14 value-mismatch, 2 non-deterministic (BNODE labels) |
| grouping | 6 | 4 | 2 unsupported-construct (missing non-grouped-var rejection) |
| negation | 12 | 12 | — |
| project-expression | 7 | 7 | — |
| property-path | 33 | 24 | 9 property-path (inverse-in-NPS, `*`/`?` over sets) |

The ledgered gaps are genuine (the curated subset simply never exercised these
surfaces). `parse-unsupported` VALUES cases are cleared by the trailing-`VALUES`
parser fix; `value-mismatch` marks real evaluation-correctness gaps to close.

## Vendored files & fidelity

| Group | Query / Data | Fidelity |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| aggregates | `agg-numeric.ttl`, `agg-group-builtin.rq`, `agg-sum-01.rq`, `agg-multiple-having.rq` | **verbatim** from `sparql/sparql11/aggregates/` |
| subquery | `sq13.rq`, `sq13.ttl` | **verbatim** from `sparql/sparql11/subquery/` |
| service | `service0{1,2,3,4a,5,6,7}.rq`, `service0{1..7}.srx`, `data*.ttl` (default-graph + per-endpoint) | **verbatim** from `sparql/sparql11/service/` |

The expected-result files (`*.srx`) for the `aggregates` and `subquery` groups are
**reconstructed to a semantically equivalent** SPARQL Results XML document: the
harness compares SELECT results as a W3C *solution-set multiset* (via the native
`from_xml` reader), so the exact bytes of those upstream `.srx` are immaterial —
only the solution content is, and that is reproduced faithfully from the upstream
expected results. The `service` group's `.srx` files are vendored **verbatim** to
exercise the reader against the upstream fixtures as-published (see the
upstream-erratum note below).

## Curation rationale

- `agg-group-builtin` — `GROUP BY (DATATYPE(?o) AS ?d)` directly exercises the
  expression-valued `GROUP BY`.
- `agg-multiple-having` — `HAVING (COUNT(*) > 1) (COUNT(*) < 3)` exercises
  multi-condition `HAVING`.
- `agg-sum-01` — `SUM` over the XSD decimal value space.
- `subquery13` ("Subqueries don't inject bindings") — a nested `SELECT` whose
  inner variable scope is independent of the outer query; it also exercises
  blank-node property lists (`[ rdfs:label ?L ]`).

## The W3C federated `service` group runs offline

The W3C `sparql11/service` tests bundle **each remote endpoint's data in the
manifest** via `qt:serviceData [ qt:endpoint <ep> ; qt:data <file> ]`. The harness
resolves every endpoint through an in-memory source (`LocalRemoteQuerySource`),
which dog-foods the native engine — no socket, no live HTTP, fully deterministic.
The whole group therefore runs offline alongside the rest of the suite.

Of the seven vendored cases, four pass outright (a simple `SERVICE` join, a
`SERVICE` with an `OPTIONAL SERVICE`, a `SERVICE SILENT` against an invalid
endpoint that swallows to the join identity, and `service7` whose upstream
expected-result file uses an empty `<binding>` element to denote an unbound
variable — an older producer convention that the reader now tolerates correctly).
The remaining three are recorded as explicit expected-failures (never silently
skipped) for these capability gaps:

- **nested `SERVICE`** — a `SERVICE` clause inside another `SERVICE`'s pattern is
  not yet evaluated against its inner endpoint (*unsupported-construct*).
- **trailing top-level `VALUES`** — a `VALUES` clause after the `WHERE` block is
  not yet accepted by the parser, only inline `VALUES` inside a group
  (*unsupported-construct*).
- **variable-endpoint `SERVICE ?var`** — needs the lateral binding seam to bind the
  endpoint from the surrounding solution before federating (*pending-service*).

Live federation over real HTTP endpoints is exercised separately by the maintainer
network-lane test (`crates/sparql-eval/tests/service_live.rs`), which drives the
real `HttpRemoteQuerySource`.
